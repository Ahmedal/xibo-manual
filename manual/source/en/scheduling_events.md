#Events
Events are Layouts or Campaigns assigned to Displays at specific dates and times.

The event form can be launched from the Calendar Control buttons and by clicking on any existing event in the calendar.

When launched the form looks like this:

##Recurring Events
The scheduler features the ability to create recurring events. To set recurrence for events, select the required "Repeats" value from the list and the appropriate additional fields will be revealed.

A scheduled event can be repeated at defined interval (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly) until the specified date / time.

##Priority Events
Priority schedules allow an event to be added that overrides all other non-priority events on the schedule. This functionality is useful for displaying temporary important notices, or overriding the schedule for a specific event without having to cancel the layouts that would normally be running at that time.

When adding a new schedule, or when editing an existing schedule, tick the "Priority" box to make the schedule override the others. 

Multiple priority events may be scheduled concurrently. They will be shown in a cycle in the same way as non-priority layouts would be.

##Deleting an Event
To delete an event, first open the Schedule Form and then select the "Delete" button from the button bar on the form. The Delete Event form will open allowing confirmation of the Delete.
