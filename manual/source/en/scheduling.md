#Scheduling
[[PRODUCTNAME]] has a sophisticated scheduling system allowing for scheduling Layouts and Campaigns across Displays and Display Groups. This is achieved through Schedule Events and visualised on the Calendar.

Events have the following properties:

- Events spanning two dates - no maximum or minimum time
- Recurring events
- Priority events
- Schedule an event for more that one Display / Display Group at once

When a Display has more than one Layout scheduled to it at one time it will automatically alternate between the Layouts in the schedule.

If at any time there are no layouts scheduled to run, the default layout for the Display will be run automatically.
