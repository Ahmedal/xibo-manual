# Windows Client Multi-install
It is possible to configure the windows client to run multiple instances on a single PC.

To do this requires some manual steps.

1. Install the client normally following the [installation instructions](install_windows_client.html).
2. Navigate to the client installation folder
3. Copy the entire folder and rename to something unique (for example a 2 at the end).
4. Navigate inside the new folder, rename XiboClient.exe to XiboClient2.exe
5. Create a short cut to the new EXE which has the character `o` in the arguments section.
6. Double click the short cut and configure the client as normal.
7. Double click the EXE and the client should start.
