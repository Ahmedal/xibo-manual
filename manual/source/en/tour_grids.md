#Grids
The CMS presents many of the entities (layouts, media, campaigns, etc) as tabular data called Grids. Each grid has a number of elements that combine to create a flexible administration tool that is easy to read and understand.

The following diagram is the Layout grid annotated with each of its elements.

## Action Menu
The action menu provides any page wide actions that can be performed. The most common action to feature here is the filter form action to show / hide the filter form (if one is available on the grid). Other common actions include the ability to "Add" a new item.

## Filter Form
Most grids have a filter form which is used to restrict the results in some way. The restriction is typically a filter - for example all Layouts belonging to a particular user.

### Keep Open
The selections in the filter form can be memorised for future visits to the same page by ticking the "Keep Open" check box.

## Data Table
The data table is where the existing contents of the CMS are displayed. The columns in the data table may be changeable via the filter form.

### Sortable Columns
Most columns are sortable by default, and where the column has an up or down arrow the "SHIFT" key can also be used to multi-sort the column.

### The Row Menu
Each row may also have an action menu for things can can be done to that specific row. This menu can be accessed by clicking the down arrow in the right-most column of each row.

## Multi-select
Some grids include the ability to multi-select rows and perform bulk actions. These are actions that can be run on all of the selected rows at the same time. Once the rows have been selected the "With Selected" button is used to access the bulk actions menu for those rows.

###Paging
If available a paging control will be shown that allows the user to switch between multiple pages of results.
