# Layout Designer (New Features for v2)

The Layout Designer is the heart of **content creation** in [[PRODUCTNAME]]. Each time a new Layout is added, or an existing one needs a design change, the Layout Designer is used.

{tip}
If you are using the **1.8** series CMS, please use the following link: [Layout Designer 1.8](layouts_designer_1.8.html)
{/tip}

[[PRODUCTNAME]] makes layout design simple through the use of **drag and drop**,**interactive previewing** and **design flexibility**. On adding a new Layout the Layout Designer will open in **Read Only Mode**.

The **Layout Designer** will open and confirm that the Layout has been 'checked out' ready for editing.

## Layout Navigator

This is located in the top right corner of the Layout Designer window. As shown in the above image, all new Layouts, by default, have one full screen empty [Region](layouts_regions.html), represented as a white semi-transparent overlay.  The Layout Navigator can be used to add, position and resize Regions and gives an overview to the overall layout design.

## Layout Timeline

Located next to the Layout Navigator the Layout Timeline displays the duration of individual Widgets as well as complete layout duration which is based on the longest running region on the layout.

A status indicator is shown (cross or tick) to identify valid and invalid Layouts.  **Invalid layouts will be excluded from the Schedule and will not be played.**

{tip}
A Layout must contain at least one Region **and** each Region must contain at least **one** media item for it to be valid and play when scheduled.
