# Troubleshooting
Need help? Please ask for help or advice in the [[[PRODUCTNAME]] Community]([[PRODUCTSUPPORTURL]]).

It is likely that the support representative will ask you to visit the Fault page in the CMS so that some logging can be generated for your issue. 

When asking for assistance it is essential that as much information as possible is included. A minimum of the version of the software you are using and the steps to recreate the problem you are having.

General questions are also welcome!

## Logging
The CMS has a central "error log" which collects messages from all components in the platform - CMS, Players, API, 
 Maintenance, etc. Providing relevant information from the log is often the key to a support representative finding the
 solution to any problems.
 
CMS logging can be provided from the Fault page, but for a better understanding of Log content see [understanding the log](advanced_logging.html).
