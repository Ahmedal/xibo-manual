# Templates

Templates are saved copies of Layouts which can then be used to create new Layouts. Using a Template can speed up the design process as well as maintaining a corporate image/standard.

## Saving a Layout as a Template

Templates are saved in the Layout Designer by using the **Actions** tab and clicking on the **Save Template** button. Complete the form fields and select whether to include all the Widgets to the Template and Save.

Once saved, Templates can be selected by Users (with appropriate Permissions) when creating a new Layout.

All saved Templates can be managed from the Design section of the Menu and by using the row menu for the selected Template.
