# Logging
The CMS has a central repository for all log information, including the Players which send back log information with
 each collection from CMS.
 
The log is split into *channels*, *functions* and *pages* for easy searching. Each unique request has a *runNo* to
 group messages together.
 
The log is accessible from the *Log* page in the CMS administration portal.

## Finding your message
Understanding the log can be complicated in a busy system and it can often be hard to find messages related to your
 interest. The log can be filtered for this purpose, it is usually best to start with the Channel, then the Function
 and finally (if necessary) the page.
 
For example, if an API call to the statistics search function is not working as expected the log can be searched for API,
 GET and `/stats`.
