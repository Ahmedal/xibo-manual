# CMS Dashboards

The assigned Dashboard will be the first screen that **Users** will see after login. There are three **Dashboard views** of the CMS that can be assigned to Users. 

## Status Dashboard

The CMS Status Dashboard is the default Dashboard for **Super Admin Users** and is intended as a high-level view of the system for Administrators. It provides information relating to Library and Bandwidth usage, Display Activity and Latest news.

## Icon Dashboard 

The CMS Icon Dashboard is the default Dashboard for all new assigned **Users** and is intended as a **Launcher** into other areas of the CMS. The icons within the Dashboard are shown/hidden according to the menu permissions for the User.

## Media Dashboard

The CMS Media Dashboard can be enabled for **Users** who should only edit the **Media** they have been given permission for. The Media Dashboard gives a restricted access view of the CMS presented in a grid style interface which lists each item the User has permissions to edit.

Ensure that your User has the required Permissions applied so that they can access the Media Dashboard and view/edit content of a Layout. See [Permissions](users_permissions.html) for guidance.
