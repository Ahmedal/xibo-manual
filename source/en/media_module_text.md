### Text Editor

![Edit Text](img/v2_media_text_edit.png)

Click in the Preview window to open the inline editor to enter text and apply formatting.

The text editor will open with the same background as selected for the Layout and will use a complimentary text colour for the chosen background colour.

![Enter Text](img/v2_media_enter_text.png)

The thin red border in the text editing window represents the **Region** size. Ensure that formatted text remains within this border.

Optionally use date/time merge tags, available from the **Snippets** menu. 

### General

- Provide an optional name.

- Choose to override the default duration.

  {tip}

  It is typical to have a text item as the only media item assigned to a Region, therefore the duration can be set to a low value.

### Effect

- Use the drop-down menu to select an effect to be applied to your text.
- Select a speed for the selected effect.
- Optionally add a background colour.
- Include a selector to use for marquee items.

**Additional Fonts** can be added to this editor by uploading files to the **Library**. Please be aware that fonts have 'preferences' built into them known as OS/2 tags. [[PRODUCTNAME]] checks these OS/2 preferences, and can use fonts with OS/2 tags 0 or 8. Fonts with other tags may not display correctly or you may receive an error on upload.
