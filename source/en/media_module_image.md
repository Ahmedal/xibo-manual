# Image

Add an image to a Layout using the Image Widget, by adding a file to upload directly or choosing an image that has already been added to the [Library](media_library.html). 

**Caution should be taken as uploading very large Images can cause issues for the Player.**

<tip>

We recommend uploading JPG or PNG files, ensuring that Users check the resolution of the Image and keep it within the intended screen size.
