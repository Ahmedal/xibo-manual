## Layout Assignments
Layouts can be assigned directly to a display or display group so that they are always available in the local
library of the player.

Once assigned the layout and its content will be downloaded to the display at the next collection interval or if XMR is installed the file
will be downloaded immediately.

Layouts are assigned by selecting the *Assign Layouts* row menu item on either the Display or Display Group page.

A layout can be removed from the same form and will be cleaned up when the player needs space or after 30 days of that layout
no-longer being required.
