#### **Agenda**

Events can span multiple days/weeks/months so it is highly useful to be able to see a precise representation of Layouts/Campaigns that will be shown on a selected Display at a point in time.

![Agenda View](img/scheduling_calendar_agenda.png)

The selected Displays/Display Groups will be presented as tabs with Layouts shown in tabular format which appear in the order they will cycle on the Display.

Use the slider, located above the tabs, to pinpoint the exact time of day to view. Change the date using the **Prev/Today/Next** buttons or by selecting a date using the calendar icon.

Click on a Layout to highlight the associated information (associations will turn blue) and view the breadcrumb, to show further Campaign and Display Group information. If nested Display Groups have been configured, these will show in the breadcrumb.
