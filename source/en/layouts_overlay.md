# Overlay Layouts

A Layout can be created to be specifically scheduled as an Overlay Layout so that your important information, such as company details, logo, can exist across other Layouts scheduled at the same time.

## Create an Overlay Layout

Overlay Layouts are created in exactly the same way as all other Layouts. Add Regions to fit around your existing content so that your Overlay Layout will "sit on top" of other Layouts that are Scheduled at the same time. Your Overlay Layout will display its all important content whilst the Layouts "underneath" playout in rotation.

<tip>
[[PRODUCTNAME]] will not render the background on an Android or webOS Players when a Layout is scheduled as an Overlay Layout.

With the Windows Player you will need to match the background so its the same colour/image as the Layout you are overlaying.

## Scheduling

Overlay Layouts are selected as an **Event type** when [Scheduling an Event](scheduling_events.html).
