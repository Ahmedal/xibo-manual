# Library Search (New Features for v2)

The Library Search feature is used as a quick and easy way to assign **media** to **Layouts** which has already been uploaded to the Library.

Located on the bottom of the toolbar, click on the magnifying glass icon to create a new search tab.

Search fields can be used to search the CMS Library by **Name**, **Tag** or by using the drop down menu to search by a media **Type**. Click on the **Search** button to return results.

Returned results will show above the toolbar. Use the arrows to scroll through uploaded **media** files and click or drag to add to a **Region**.
