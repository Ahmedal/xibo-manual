# Google Traffic

Traffic data can be added to a Layout using the Google Traffic Widget. The Widget takes the 
following options:

 - Name
 - Duration
 - Display Location / Lat & Long
 - Zoom
 
The traffic data can be based on the location of each display by ticking "Display Location".
Once ticked the lat/long recorded on the Display record is used. This means you can have
one Layout of traffic data which is reused on multiple displays and shows the traffic in
the correct location on each display.

You can also specify a lat/long manually.

The Zoom setting relates to how close/far away the ariel view of the map is. The higher
the number the closer to ground level. A zoom of 1 is "whole globe".
