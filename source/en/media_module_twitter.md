## Installation

Access to the Twitter API is protected and so Users must register for an **API key** which is then entered into the Twitter Module in the [[PRODUCTNAME]] CMS. 

### Connecting to Twitter

- Obtain an **API key** and **API secret** from [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com) and then log in to your Twitter account. 

**Please note:** You will need to apply for a **Twitter developer account** if you are not already approved, using the above Twitter link.

- Complete the required fields and accept the Terms of Service.
- Solve the CAPTCHA and submit the form.
- Make a note of the generated consumer key (API key) and consumer secret (API secret).

### Twitter Module Installation

- Select the Modules page under the Administration section and install the Twitter Module.
- Once installed click on the row menu for the Twitter Module and click **Edit**.
- Enter the generated **API key** and **API secret**.
- Optionally adjust the Cache Period to determine how long to cache a results set for each Twitter search.

<tip>

Setting a low value can cause your access to the Twitter API to be disabled for generating too many requests.
