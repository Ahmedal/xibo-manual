# Reporting

[[PRODUCTNAME]] provides useful **metrics** for Users, who have the relevant permissions, to view within the CMS. These are designed to provide a centralised area for analysis into Display performance and usage and are available from the Reporting section on the menu.

## Display Statistics

The CMS records the bandwidth used by each Display when connecting to XMDS for content and when reporting back Display information. 

The default view for the bandwidth chart is a total per Display.

Filtering to just one Display helps to better understand where bandwidth was used.
